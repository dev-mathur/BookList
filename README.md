# BookList
Technologies Used:
A simple project using vanilla JS
UI was created through a Bootstrap 4 theme

Overview
This application takes in information about the book you want to store such as the title, author name, and ISBN number and stores and displays the book into the frontend.

Outcome
This was just a simple exercise to practice my basic javascript skills. I want to make sure that I am strong in the basics before diving deep into frameworks
